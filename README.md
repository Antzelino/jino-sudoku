In this repository I'm trying to implement a Sudoku solver in C, which solves the Sudoku the same way a human would (potentially, will be able to play as well).

For now it's only in the terminal and it works in Linux only, but maybe that will change some time in the future.

```bash
# Compile to executable "./sudoku"
make
# or
make sudoku

# Compile and run executable
make run

# Delete executable and object files
make clean
```

# Useful Resources
